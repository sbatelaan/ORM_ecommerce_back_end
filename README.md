# 13 ORM-E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
This **e-commerce** application is developed using starter code to create a back-end application for an e-commerce site that uses the command line interface (CLI) and object-relational mapping for various methods of data manipulation, storage, and retrieval when using HTTP methods with a RESTUL API.
 It utlises Express.js API which uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database in order to build a back end for a shop's website.
